The problem
Create a word hangman game.

Hint
The word hangman is a simple game. You will provide a word with the first letter. Rest of the letters will be blank. For example,

s_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

The player has to guess the letters in the word. And the player will guess one letter at a time. If the letter exists in the word, it will appear to the player.

If the letter doesnâ€™t exist in the word, it will be counted as a wrong try.

If the player exceeds the number of the wrong tries, the player will lose.

Otherwise, the player will win.
Guess letters one at a time.

Win by guessing all letters before 6 wrong attempts.
